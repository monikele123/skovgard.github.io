    <h1>26 Quick and Easy Dinners Ready in 15 Minutes or Less</h1>
    <img class="poultry" src="images/Poultry.jpg" alt="Poultry">

    <h3>We’ve all been there: You’re home late from work, bordering on hangry—if you don't have a meal in less than 20 minutes, you might go into Hulk mode. You think your only quick-fix options are delivery (which starts to cut into your budget) or a frozen entrée (which never seems to satisfy).
<br>
<br>
    New plan: Head to the kitchen. There are plenty of healthy dinners you can whip up with minimal ingredients—many that you likely have on hand—in 15 minutes tops. Whether burgers are calling your name, soup sounds ideal, or only cheesy pasta will do, you can prep, cook, and devour in no time by choosing one of these fast foods. And no worries: While they're ready in a flash, they don't scrimp on taste.

<h1><a target="_blank" href="sandwitches.html">Open-Face Chicken Caprese Sandwiches</a></h1>
    

    <h3>Turn the popular Caprese salad appetizer into a light main course in a matter of minutes by adding protein in the form of chicken and some carbohydrates in the form of French bread. Top with vine-ripe tomatoes that aren’t just juicy complements to the mozzarella but may contain more cancer-fighting lycopene than the ones that ripen off the vine. It’s simple, fast, and guaranteed to hit the spot.</h3>

<h1><a target="_blank" href="paleo.html"> Paleo Taco Salad</a></h1>
    

<h3>A colorful pile of romaine, avocados, Roma tomatoes, and more topped with seasoned ground turkey make this protein- and fiber-rich meal fit for a fast dinner. Even the homemade taco seasoning, with metabolism-boosting spices like cayenne and chili powder, is part of the 15-minute deal (though you can use packaged too if you don't want to buy a ton of spices).1 Just watch the sodium content.</h3>
