    <h1>Cooking for One: Insanely Easy, Healthy Meals You Can Make in Minutes</h1>
    <img class="solo" src="images/solo.jpg" alt="solo">

    <h3>If you're anything like us, you've googled "healthy meals for one" more than a few times. After all, the usual sandwich and salad combos start to get stale, frozen dinners become downright depressing, and no we don't always want to meal-prep and have the same dinner five nights in a row. Sure, there's always takeout, but it's not the best option—for your wallet or your health—in the long run. We recognize that cooking for one can be a bit of a challenge, though.
<br>
<br>
    And that's why we've pulled together a list of the best easy meals for one. Even better: We've broken them down by meal. That means you get to cobble together an insanely tasty menu, like cinnamon roll Greek yogurt pancakes for breakfast, a Mediterranean grilled cheese sandwich for lunch, and a vegetarian burrito bowl for dinner. And dessert? Like we'd forget about that. There's a one-minute coffee cake that's yours for the taking.
    <br>
    <br>
    We know the fear of leftover fatigue or doing the math to modify recipes for a single serving (why do so many recipes make so much at once?) can drive anyone to call it quits. But not only can cooking healthy recipes provide some much-needed alone time, it's also a lot quicker than cooking for a crowd. Tie on your apron, because these 25 tasty and healthy meals for one will inspire you to get in the kitchen and get quick and easy meals on the table.

<h1>Blueberry Paleo Protein Waffle</h1>
    <img class="waffle" src="images/waffles.jpg" alt="waffle">

    <h3>Skip the Eggos and whip up these protein-packed waffles instead. Vanilla protein powder and healthy subs such as coconut flour and coconut sugar make these a sweet and filling a.m. meal that packs a nutritional punch. Skip the syrup... a honey-and-lemon drizzle kicks the flavor up a notch while cutting down on sugar.</h3>
